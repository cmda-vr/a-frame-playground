* Voxels will be like a box but attached with a few custom A-frame components.
* Every single object in an A-Frame scene is <a-entity>, which by itself doesnâ€™t do anything, like an empty <div>. We plug in components (not to be confused with Web or React Components) to that entity to provide with appearance, behavior , and logic.
* The Benefits of components is that they are composable. Mix and match existing components.
* Components in A-frame are defined in JavaScript.
* Create mixin to define reusable bundle of components
